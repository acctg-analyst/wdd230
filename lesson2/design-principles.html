        <h3>White Space</h3>
        <h4>Owl Labs</h4>
        <p><a href="https://owllabs.com" target="_blank">Owl Labs Link</a></p>
        <img src="images/white-space-exp.png" alt="Owl Labs Home Page" />
        <p>
          The main reason that I picked owl labs as my example of white space was becasue of the
          minimalistic style of their home page. I really love how they keep the background simple
          with just a picture that isn't too distracting.

        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <h4>Apple Inc.</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple Link</a></p>
        <img src="images/visual-high-exp.png" alt="Apple Home Page" />
        <p>
          I decided to go with apple for the visual Hierarchy. The main reason for that is because
          of their text sizes and icon sizes. The largest things are what they want your eyes drawn
          to first. In this example, you will see 'Iphone 14 Pro' is the most important thing they
          want you to see on the page. That is becasue it is describing what is in the picture.

        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <h4>Odd Pears</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.oddpears.com" target="_blank">Odd Pears Link</a></p>
        <img src="images/contrast-exp.png" alt="Odd Pears Home Page" />
        <p>
          The website that I picked for contrast was Odd Pears. This website does a very good job
          with their color contrast. They were able to incorporate fun interesting colors and still
          make things easy to read. The fact that they have pink text that is still readable is
          really interesting to me. Overall, really good example of color contrast.

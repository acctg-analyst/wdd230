        <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
        <p>
          The taget audience that I am hoping to reach here is an audience that is looking to gain
          more information about the city of Boise. Generally speaking, that will be adults both
          male and female. From there we could narrow it down to business people and those looking
          to explore the city more. Perhaps this could encompass travelers as well as local business
          persons and family members.
        </p>
        <h2>Personas:</h2>

                <img src="images/business-person.png" alt="Small Business Person">
                <p>Occupation: Local Small Business Owner</p>
                <p>The first Persona that I figured would represent our target audience, would be a
                small business owner. This group would be interested in the networking portion of
                the website. It would also allow the business to connect with the city.</p>

                <img src="images/traveler.png" alt="A person hiking symbolizing a traveler">
                <p>Occupation: A Traveler</p>
                <p>The second persona that I figured would use this website would be a traveler.
                Often times, those traveling through the city are interested in knowing the events
                that are going on. They could also use this to find what makes the city unique.</p>

        <p>
          Bountiful Foods is a fresh foods drink creator. They have been around for a very long time
          (1920) and have a variety of drinks. Bountiful Foods aims to help people find drinks that
          help energize them and propel them throughout their day. We inspire creativity in your
          life by allowing you to control what you drink with our custom drink option. We hope to
          eventually grow and spread through the valley. However, the first step in doing this is
          building a website to attact a larger market. We hope to expand our marketing efforts and
          take in a larger market share in the healthy drink industry.
